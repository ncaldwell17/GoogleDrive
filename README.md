# GoogleDrive

GoogleDrive is a Python code repository that demonstrates how to use the Google Drive API to interact with their online filesystem.

## Getting Started
In order to follow along with this tutorial set, you'll need to go to this [link](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/quickstart/python) that will provide a simple interface to enable your API related to a particular project. Once you enable this API, you'll be able to run the quickstart.py file in terminal to obtain your 'token.pickle' object that will store your login credentials. Once this is done and all of the required libraries are installed, you'll be able to import and run the code in the Jupyter Notebooks.
